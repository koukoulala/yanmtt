## names of the bpe and spm models are set to sentencepiece.bpe and spiece as those are the names that the tokenizer implementations expect.

# Notes: the create_autotokenizer.sh script takes 5 arguments:
# paths to files: this should be a comma separated list
# vocabulary size: an integer
# path to the saved tokenizer: remember to use the prefixes albert or mbart for when you want sentencepiece or bpe subword segmentation, respectively, encapsulated by the AlbertTokenizer or the MBartTokenizer, respectively. Why? Because the AutoTokenizer class likes having the prefix to the tokenizer name so that it can resolve which tokenizer class should be used internally. Note that I personally prefer sentencepiece over BPE have not played with the MbartTokenizer that much.
# tokenizer type: albert or mbart for sentencepiece or BPE, respectively.
# user defined tokens: keep as "." (full stop) if you dont want to specify any special tokens. Specify a comma separated list of tokens such as <2x>,<2y> if you plan to use special tokens. Note that you will have to mess with the data and batch generation method to ensure that these tokens are appropriately used but I have faith in you, King/Queen.
